## Introduction

Bootstrap is a versatile and responsive front-end framework that simplifies web development. With Bootstrap, you can easily create stunning websites, web applications, and mobile applications.

## Requirements

To use Bootstrap effectively, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

- Bootstrap: You must have Bootstrap installed. If you haven't already, you can download it from the official website or include it using a content delivery network (CDN).

- CSS Optimization: It's recommended to keep your `styles.css` as minimal as possible. Bootstrap offers an extensive set of classes to style your web content, so make the most of them to maintain a clean and efficient project.

## Getting Started

Getting started with Bootstrap is easy. Simply follow these steps:

1. Download Bootstrap or include it via a CDN in your HTML file.
2. Create an HTML file for your project and link the Bootstrap stylesheet and JavaScript files.
3. Start designing your web pages using Bootstrap's responsive grid system, components, and utilities.
